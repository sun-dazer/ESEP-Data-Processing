# In-Memory Key-Value Database 

## Overview

This project implements an in-memory key-value database with transaction support in C++ and supports basic operations like `get`, `put`, and transaction management (`begin_transaction`, `commit`, and `rollback`).

## How to Run the Code

### Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have `g++` installed (GCC version 9 or higher).

### Steps to Run
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
   https://github.com/sun-dazer/ESEP-Data-Processing/tree/main

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd InMemoryDBProject
3. **Compile and Run**:
   ```bash
   g++ -o main main.cpp
   ./main

## Writeup
In the future, I think this assignment can be improved by including testing files. I had to write my own in order to verify that it was working properly. Additionally, I think there should be a language requirement to make it easier for graders to have a standardized testing and running environment. Otherwise, this assignment was enjoyable.
